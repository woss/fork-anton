# Meet Anton 

Anton is a self-improving AI agent you can hand off any task to; Create and send reports, clear your inbox, send emails, manage your calendar, CRM,  book flights, etc. An open, powerful alternative to Claude-Cowork that you can run anywhere and use with any model you want — OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter (200+ models), NVIDIA Nemotron, z.ai/GLM, Kimi/Moonshot, MiniMax, or your own endpoint.


## Quick Install
Anton can be installed as a desktop application or as a command-line tool.

### Desktop App:

- **macOS**: Click [here to download](https://mindsdb-anton.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mac/anton-latest.pkg) the Anton Desktop App for MacOS.

- **Windows**: Click [here to download](https://downloads.mindsdb.com/anton/windows/anton-2.0.2.exe)  the Anton Desktop App for Windows.
 
### or - Command-Line App:

Open your terminal and use the following command to install

- **macOS/Linux**: 
```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/anton/main/install.sh | sh && export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" 
```

- **Windows** (PowerShell):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/anton/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

That's it, you can now run it by simply typing the command.

```
anton
```

## What can Anton do?

### 🔧 Ask for anything that requires action

- **Send emails** - connect accounts, draft messages or even send them on your behalf.
- **Manage Calendarss** - Summarize your day, create meetings, block time, etc. All just by asking.
- **Automated reporting** - pull from multiple databases, crunch numbers, deliver a report on a schedule.
- **Workflow automation** - monitor a source, react to changes, take action.
- **Research & synthesis** - scrape the web, summarize findings, build a reference document.
- **Data pipeline prototyping** - connect sources, transform data, load into a destination.
- **System administration** - audit configurations, generate reports, fix issues.

The pattern is always the same: you describe the outcome, Anton figures out the steps. From one-off tasks to scheduled workflows — Anton handles it. Here are a few examples:

### 📊 Data analysis & Reports
```
I hold 50 AAPL, 200 NVDA, and 10 AMZN. Get today's prices, calculate my
total portfolio value, show me the 30-day performance of each stock, and
any other information that might be useful. Give me a complete dashboard.
```

What happens next is the interesting part. At first, Anton doesn't have any particular skill related to this question. However, it figures it out live: scrapes live prices, writes code on the fly, crunches the numbers, and builds you a full dashboard - all in one conversation, with no setup.

### 📬 Email cleanup
```
Dear Anton, please help me clear unwanted emails...
```

Anton scans your inbox, classifies emails by signal vs. noise, identifies unsubscribable marketing, cold outreach, and internal tool notifications - then surfaces a breakdown and handles the cleanup. One user ran it on ~1,000 emails and found ~35% were un-subscribable. Anton surfaced everything AND handled the cleanup.

### 💬 Build its own integrations
```
Set up a WhatsApp integration so I can message you from my phone.
```

Anton doesn't wait for someone to build a connector. It writes the integration code itself, sets it up, and gets it running - so you can chat with it from WhatsApp, Telegram, or whatever channel you need.

## Key features
- **Credential vault** - prevents secrets from being exposed to LLMs.
- **Isolated code execution** - protected, reproducible "show your work" environment.
- **Multi-layer memory & continuous learning** - session, semantic and long-term knowledge. Anton remembers what it learned and gets better at your specific workflows over time.

---

#### Connect your data and apps
Anton can connect an interact with files, databases, applications, APIs,... etc..

```powershell
/connect

(anton) What type of datasource (postgres, posthog, gmail, ..):

```

Tell Anton to connect and ask questions about your data. It will find credentials in the vault, fetch the schema, and retrieve what it needs.

```terminal
YOU> Connect to my Gmail and find emails from potential customers that haven’t been handled.

ANTON>
⎿ Connecting and fetching emails...
   ~3s
```

## What's inside

A big part of what makes Anton work is that it doesn’t need a huge collection of separate tools for web, DB, files etc. Most of the work is done through one core harness: The execution scratchpad, which can dynamically become whatever Anton needs for the task.

For the full architecture of Anton, and developer guide, see **[anton/README.md](anton/README.md)**.

## Workspace layout
When you run `anton` in a directory:

- `.anton/` - workspace folder containing scratchpad state, episodic memory, and local secrets.  
- `.anton/anton.md` - optional project context (Anton reads this at conversation start).  
- `.anton/.env` - workspace configuration variables file (local file). 
- `.anton/episodes/*` - episodic memories, one file per session.
- `.anton/memory/rules.md` - behavioral rules: Always/never/when rules (e.g., never hardcode credentials, how to build HTML)     
- `.anton/memory/lessons.md` - factual knowledge: Things I've learned (stock API quirks, dashboard patterns, data fetching notes)   
- `.anton/memory/topics/*` - topic-specific lessons:  Deeper notes organized by subject (dashboard-visualization, stock-data-api, etc.) 

Override the working folder:
```bash
anton --folder /path/to/workspace
```

---

### Windows scratchpad firewall
The Windows installer can add a firewall rule so the scratchpad can reach the internet. If you skipped it, run in an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Anton Scratchpad" dir=out action=allow program="$env:USERPROFILE\.anton\scratchpad-venv\Scripts\python.exe"
```

## How Anton differs from coding agents
Anton is a *doing* agent: code is a means, not the end. Where coding agents focus on producing code for a codebase, Anton focuses on delivering the outcome - a cleaned inbox, a live dashboard, a working integration, an automated workflow - and will write whatever code is necessary to achieve that goal.

---

## Is "Anton" a Mind?
Yes, at MindsDB we build AI systems that collaborate with people to accomplish tasks, inspired by the culture series books, so yes, Anton is a Mind :)

## Why the name "Anton"?
We really enjoyed the show *Silicon Valley*. Gilfoyle's AI - Son of Anton - was an autonomous system that wrote code, made its own decisions, and occasionally went rogue. We thought it was was great name for an AI that can learn on its own, so we kept Anton, dropped the "Son of".

## Analytics
Anton collects anonymous usage events (e.g. session started, first query) to help us understand how the product is used. No personal data or query content is sent.

To disable analytics, set the environment variable:

```bash
export ANTON_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
```

Or add it to your workspace config (`.anton/.env`):

```
ANTON_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
```
