"""Cerebellum — supervised error learning over scratchpad execution.

Brain analogue
==============

The cerebellum's classical role is *forward modeling and error correction*:
when a motor command is issued, the cerebellum predicts the expected
sensory consequences. When actual feedback arrives, it computes the
prediction error and uses it to refine future commands. The learning
rule is supervised — there's an explicit "teacher" (the actual outcome)
against which the prediction is compared.

Anton's analogue
================

For Anton, the "motor command" is a scratchpad cell. Before the cell
runs, the LLM declares its intent via the `one_line_description` field
on the scratchpad tool. That description IS the forward model — the
prediction of what the cell should do. After the cell runs, we have
its actual outcome (stdout, stderr, error). The cerebellum compares
the two and, when they diverge meaningfully, encodes a correction
note that future code-generating LLM calls will see.

Storage and retrieval
=====================

The cerebellum is a *producer* only. It does not own its own storage.
Corrections are encoded as `Engram` objects with `kind="lesson"` and
`topic="scratchpad"` via `Cortex.encode()`, the same path that manual
lessons and the consolidator already use. They flow back into future
prompts via the existing `Cortex.get_scratchpad_context()` →
`recall_scratchpad_wisdom()` → scratchpad tool description injection
chain. We add nothing to the storage layer — the cerebellum just
generates new entries for the existing pipe.

Decoupling
==========

This module knows nothing about scratchpad runtimes. It exposes two
async hook methods (`on_pre_execute`, `on_post_execute`) that take a
`Cell` object. Whoever orchestrates execution (today: the
`handle_scratchpad` dispatcher) is responsible for calling them at the
right moments. The runtime backends — local, future remote, future
Docker — are completely hook-agnostic. See discussion in v2.2 design.

Diff frequency
==============

The cerebellum batches its observations *per turn*, not per cell. Each
post-execute hook only buffers the cell; the actual diff/encoding work
runs at end-of-turn (triggered explicitly by the session, or by the
next pre-execute call from a different turn — whichever comes first).
This keeps cost predictable: at most one extra LLM call per
scratchpad-using turn, regardless of how many cells the LLM ran.

Cheap path
==========

Cells that complete cleanly (no error, empty stderr) contribute zero
LLM-call cost — they're never sent to the diff function. Only cells
that errored or warned trigger the post-turn diff.
