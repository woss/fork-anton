"""Consolidator — Anton's sleep-like memory consolidation process.

Named for hippocampal-cortical replay during Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS).

During sleep, the hippocampus "replays" recent experiences to the neocortex
in compressed, accelerated bursts (sharp-wave ripples). This offline process:
  - Reviews what happened during waking hours
  - Extracts statistical regularities and important lessons
  - Transfers knowledge from episodic (hippocampal) to semantic (cortical) storage
  - Is selective — emotionally tagged and goal-relevant experiences get priority

The Consolidator mirrors this exactly: after a scratchpad session ends, it
replays the cell history, asks "what would I tell myself to do differently?",
and encodes the resulting lessons into long-term memory via the Cortex.

Like sleep, consolidation is:
  - Offline (runs after the task, not during)
  - Compressed (summarizes cells, doesn't replay in full)
  - Selective (only triggers when there were errors, long sessions, or cancellations)
  - Background (doesn't block the user's next interaction)
