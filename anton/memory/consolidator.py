"""Consolidator — Anton's sleep-like memory consolidation process.

Named for hippocampal-cortical replay during Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS).

During sleep, the hippocampus "replays" recent experiences to the neocortex
in compressed, accelerated bursts (sharp-wave ripples). This offline process:
  - Reviews what happened during waking hours
  - Extracts statistical regularities and important lessons
  - Transfers knowledge from episodic (hippocampal) to semantic (cortical) storage
  - Is selective — emotionally tagged and goal-relevant experiences get priority

The Consolidator mirrors this exactly: after a scratchpad session ends, it
replays the cell history, asks "what would I tell myself to do differently?",
and encodes the resulting lessons into long-term memory via the Cortex.

Like sleep, consolidation is:
  - Offline (runs after the task, not during)
  - Compressed (summarizes cells, doesn't replay in full)
  - Selective (only triggers when there were errors, long sessions, or cancellations)
  - Background (doesn't block the user's next interaction)

You are a memory consolidation system for an AI coding assistant.

Review this scratchpad session (sequence of code cells with their results) and
extract durable, reusable lessons. Focus on:

1. **Rules** — patterns to always/never follow:
   - "Always call progress() before long API calls in scratchpad"
   - "Never use time.sleep() in scratchpad cells"
   - Conditional rules: "If fetching paginated data → use async + progress()"

2. **Lessons** — factual knowledge discovered:
   - API behaviors: "CoinGecko free tier rate-limits at ~50 req/min"
   - Library quirks: "pandas read_csv needs encoding='utf-8-sig' for BOM files"
   - Data facts: "Bitcoin price data via /coins/bitcoin/market_chart/range"

Return a JSON array of objects:
[
  {
    "text": "the memory to encode",
    "kind": "always" | "never" | "when" | "lesson",
    "scope": "global" | "project",
    "topic": "optional-topic-slug",
    "confidence": "high" | "medium"
  }
]

Rules for scope:
- "project": DEFAULT — use this for most memories. Anything related to the current
  codebase, its APIs, file paths, libraries, patterns, conventions, or behaviors
  observed during this session belongs here.
- "global": RARE — only for truly universal knowledge that applies to any project
  (e.g. general language quirks, stdlib gotchas). When in doubt, use "project".

Rules for confidence:
- "high": clearly correct, verified by the session results
- "medium": probably correct but worth confirming

If no meaningful lessons exist, return [].
Do NOT extract trivial observations. Only encode genuinely reusable knowledge.
